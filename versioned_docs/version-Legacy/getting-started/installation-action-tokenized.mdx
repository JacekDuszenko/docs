:::warning deprecated

**The installation of Reviewpad as a GitHub action is deprecated**.

We strongly advise you to [install Reviewpad as a GitHub App](/getting-started/installation).

:::

:::caution

**This installation requires a GitHub token to be configured in your repository secrets.**

This token will be used by Reviewpad to execute the defined actions.
**This means, that the actions will appear as if they were executed by the user who created the token**.

We advise you to create a dedicated GitHub user for this purpose and to use a token generated for this user.

*If you wish to execute Reviewpad without a GitHub token, you can [install Reviewpad as GitHub action](installation-action).
Please note that you won't be able to access all  Reviewpad features.*

:::

This guide describes how to install **Reviewpad as a GitHub action with a GitHub token**.

### Why a GitHub token is required?

By default, a GitHub action runs with an [automatic token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) generated and provided by GitHub.

Although this generated token is enough to run most of Reviewpad features, some features need more permissions to run.

Therefore, to take the most out of Reviewpad, you need to generate a GitHub token with the required permissions and add it to your repository secrets.

## Step 1. Generate a GitHub token

Navigate to the option `Tokens (classic)` in your [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens), click the button `Generate new token`, and choose the option `Generate new token (classic)`.

Fill the form with the following information:
* Token name: `Reviewpad Token`
* Expiration: `No expiration`

And select the following scopes:

![GitHub add token](/img/installation-action-tokenized/permissions.png)

After that, click the green button `Generate token` and copy the generated token.

:::caution

Please note that if your organization uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), you must first [authorize the token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

## Step 2. Add the generated GitHub token to Actions Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub project (the project where you want the Reviewpad action to run).
2. Select the tab `Settings`.
3. On the left, select `Actions` under `Secrets` section.
4. Click the button `New repository secret`.
5. Add the new secret and then click on the green button `Add secret`.
    - Name: `GH_TOKEN`
    - Value: _<THE_TOKEN_GENERATED_ON_STEP_1>_

## Step 3. Open the GitHub project on your IDE

Open the GitHub project where you wish to install Reviewpad.

Use your IDE for this since we will be adding new files to the project.

## Step 4. Add `Reviewpad Action` workflow file

At the root of your repository navigate to `.github > workflows` (this is where your project's GitHub actions live; if you don't have these folders, please create them).

Add the file `reviewpad.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Reviewpad Action

on:
    - issues
    - pull_request

jobs:
    reviewpad-action:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Running reviewpad action
            uses: reviewpad/action@v3.x
            with:
                token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

## Step 5. Add `reviewpad.yml` to the root of the repository

For Reviewpad to run, you need to add a file named `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository.

This file contains the configuration for Reviewpad.

Let's add a simple Reviewpad configuration. You can change it later on :muscle:

On the root of your repository create the `reviewpad.yml` file and copy the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{LabelSizeConfiguration}</CodeBlock>

![Reviewpad add configuration](/img/installation-action-tokenized/step4.gif)

This particular configuration will label every pull request based on its size.

That's it! :tada:

**Don't forget to commit and push the `reviewpad.yml` file to your repository.**

Reviewpad will run on every pull request and follow the configuration you have set.
