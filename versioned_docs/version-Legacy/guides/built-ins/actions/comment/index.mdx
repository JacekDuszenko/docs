import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "!!raw-loader!./example.yml";

**Description**:

Posts a comment on the pull request / issue.

:::caution

Please be aware that this built-in may cause unexpected behavior.

The comment built-in is executed on each Reviewpad execution as long as the condition is met.

In the configuration below, the comment will be posted on each Reviewpad execution as long as the pull request has at least one approval.

For instance, if after getting approval there are 5 activities on the pull request (e.g. committing, pushing, labeling), the comment will be posted 5 times.

```yml
workflows:
  - name: comment
    if:
    - rule: $approvalsCount() > 0
    then:
    - $comment("This pull request has been approved.")
```

You might consider using the [`commentOnce`](./built-ins#commentonce) built-in instead.
