:::caution

**Currently, this built-in has some limitations and known issues:**

- For the [Github App](../getting-started/installation) **only non-forked and user owned forks are supported**. This is due to GitHub restrictions on committing to a pull request branch from a fork. For more information, see [this Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).
- For the [Github Action](../getting-started/installation-action-tokenized) **only non-forked repositories are supported**.

Overall, the following table shows the current support for the different scenarios:

|                         | Github App | Github Action |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Non forked              | ✓          | ✓             |
| User owned fork         | ✓          |               |
| Organization owned fork |            |               |
