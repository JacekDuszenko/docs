With Reviewpad, you can automatically add comments to the pull request.

There are three different mechanisms to add a comment to the pull request:

1. Using the [`comment`](/guides/built-ins#comment) action.
2. Using the [`commentOnce`](/guides/built-ins#commentonce) action.
3. Using the [`error`](/guides/built-ins#error), [`info`](/guides/built-ins#info) or [`warn`](/guides/built-ins#warn) actions.

The difference between the modes is that the `comment` action will add a comment every time the action is executed, `commentOnce` will add a comment once no matter the amount of times the action is executed, while the other commenting actions are bundled together in a report comment which is also automatically updated.
