Reviewpad can be used to automatically manage issues in GitHub projects.

For example, the following configuration automatically adds an issue to
a column in the board of GitHub project with a particular title.

You can also use Reviewpad to automatically move issues between columns in the board of a GitHub project
based on events such as closing or adding a label to the issue.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Similarly, you can also use Reviewpad to manage pull requests in GitHub projects.
Just add the `pull_request` event to the `on` property of the Reviewpad configuration.

The [check description](./check-issue-description) use case contains an example of a workflow
that is applied in both issues and pull requests.
