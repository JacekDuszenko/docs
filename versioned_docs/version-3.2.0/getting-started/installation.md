This guide describes how to install Reviewpad :zap:

:::tip Install with GitHub Token

Some actions required a GitHub token.

To install Reviewpad with a GitHub token please [follow this tutorial](/getting-started/installation-with-github-token)
:::

**Reviewpad runs as a GitHub action** at the level of a single GitHub repository, which means that you need to install Reviewpad for each repository where you wish to run it.

To install Reviewpad on a repository, please follow the following steps.

## Step 1. Open the GitHub project on your IDE

Open the GitHub project where you wish to install Reviewpad.

Use you're IDE for this since we will be adding new files to the project.

## Step 2. Add `Reviewpad Action` workflow file

At the root of your repository navigate to `.github > workflows` (This is where your project GitHub actions live. If you don't have these folders, please create them). 

Add the file `reviewpad.yml` and copy the following content:

```yaml
name: Reviewpad Action
on:
  pull_request

jobs:
  reviewpad-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Running reviewpad action
        uses: reviewpad/action@v3.x
```

## Step 3. Add `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository

Let's add a simple Reviewpad configuration. You can change it later on :muscle:

On the root of your repository create the `reviewpad.yml` file and copy the following content:

```yaml
api-version: reviewpad.com/v3.x

labels:
  small:
    color: "294b69"
  medium:
    color: "a8c3f7"
  large:
    color: "8a2138"

rules:
  - name: isSmall
    kind: patch
    spec: $size() <= 30

  - name: isMedium
    kind: patch
    spec: $size() > 30 && $size() <= 100

  - name: isLarge
    kind: patch
    spec: $size() > 100

workflows:
  - name: label-pull-request-with-size
    if:
      - rule: isSmall
        extra-actions:
          - $addLabel("small")
      - rule: isMedium
        extra-actions:
          - $addLabel("medium")
      - rule: isLarge
        extra-actions:
          - $addLabel("large")
```

This particular configuration will ask Reviewpad to label you PRs based on their size.

You can do much more with Reviewpad. Start by looking at some of Reviewpad [use cases](/use-cases) or jump right into the available [built-ins](/guides/built-ins).
