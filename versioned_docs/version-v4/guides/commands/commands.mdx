Reviewpad commands introduce the ability to trigger Reviewpad actions through a command-like instruction using pull request comments.

This is particularly useful when you want to trigger actions on a pull request that are not specified in the Reviewpad configuration file.

A command is a comment that follows the following format:

```shell
/reviewpad [ACTION] [ACTION_ARGUMENTS]
```

Where ACTION is the action to be triggered and ACTION_ARGUMENTS are the arguments to be passed to the action.

## Available commands

* [/reviewpad summarize](#summarize) - Comment the pull request with the summary of the changes.
* [/reviewpad explain](#explain) - Explain a piece of code with an inline comment.
* [/reviewpad assign-reviewer](#assign-reviewer) - Assign reviewer to a pull request.
* [/reviewpad assign-random-reviewer](#assign-random-reviewer) - Assign reviewer to a pull request.
* [/reviewpad dry-run](#dry-run) - Run reviewpad in dry-run mode and adds a comment with the actions that would be triggered.
* [/reviewpad run](#run) - Trigger a reviewpad run.
