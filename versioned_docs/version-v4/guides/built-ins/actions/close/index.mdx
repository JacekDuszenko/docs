import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "!!raw-loader!./example.yml";

**Description**:

Closes an pull request / issue with a given comment - without merging it.

By default, if no comment is provided, it will close the pull request / issue without a comment.

For issues, it can also be given a closure reason.

By default, if no closure reason is provided, the issue will be closed as `completed`.

When a closure reason is provided and we don't want to close the issue with a comment then we need to pass the comment parameter as `""`.

**Parameters**:

| Parameter                          | Type   | Description                                                           |
| :--------------------------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `comment` (optional)               | string | The body of the comment.                                              |
| `reason` (optional) (issues only)  | string | The reason for closing. The options are `completed` or `not_planned`. |

Please note that the `reason` parameter is only available for issues.

**Examples**:

```yml
$close()                                            # close without comment or reason
$close("Closed due inactivity")                     # close with comment and no reason
$close("", "not_planned")                           # close with no comment but reason
$close("This project is deprecated", "not_planned") # close with a comment and reason
```
