:::caution

This built-in is unavailable for issues. Reviewpad will ignored it when running on issues.

:::caution

[Please make sure you use the **check run name** and not the check suite name.](../../troubleshooting#use-check-run-name)

:::

:::caution Known issue

Please note that Reviewpad will run for **every check run** that is completed.

This can be an issue if the checks finish around the same time and you use built-ins that are not idempotent (e.g. the [comment](./built-ins#comment) built-in).
In this case, Reviewpad will run the built-in multiple times.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration:

```yml
workflows:
  - name: all-checks-completed
    if:
      - $haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success")
    then:
      - $comment("Hello")
```

In this example, if you have 5 checks Reviewpad comment "Hello" 5 times.

If checks finish all with `success` around the same time then,
when Reviewpad runs for each check, the condition of all checks being completed with `success` will be true
and Reviewpad will run `$comment("Hello")` for each check. This will result in 5 comments.

:::

**Description**:

Checks if all check runs for a pull request have been completed.

If the `check_runs_to_ignore` parameter is provided the checks with a name included in the parameter will be ignored.

If the `conclusion` parameter is provided, all check runs must be complete with the provided conclusion.

The `conclusion` parameter can be one of `action_required`, `cancelled`, `failure`, `neutral`, `success`, `skipped`, `stale` or `timed_out`.

If the `check_conclusions_to_ignore` parameter is set, any checks with a conclusion that appears in the `check_conclusions_to_ignore` list will be ignored.

**Parameters**:

| Parameter                                | Type       | Description                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `check_runs_to_ignore` (optional)        | `[]string` | List of check run names to be disregarded.                                                              |
| `conclusion` (optional)                  | `string`   | The final conclusion of the check. Empty by default. All conclusion values are valid.                   |
| `check_conclusions_to_ignore` (optional) | `[]string` | List of check conclusions to be disregarded. Any checks with a conclusion in that list will be ignored. |

**Return value**:

| Type       | Description                                                      |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `boolean`  | `true` if all check runs have been completed, `false` otherwise. |

**Examples**:

#### All check runs have been completed (regardless of the conclusion).
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted()
```

#### All check runs have been completed except for the `integration-tests` check.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted(["integration-tests"])
```

#### All check runs have been completed with a `success` conclusion.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success")
```


#### All check runs have been completed with `success` ignoring the checks with `skipped` conclusion.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success", ["skipped"])
```
