:::caution

This built-in is unavailable for issues. Reviewpad will ignore it when running on issues.

:::caution

Be aware that this built-in **DOES NOT** retrieve the list of **ALL** reviewers on a pull request but the list of the reviewers that have **REVIEWED** the pull request.

If you wish to retrieve the list of all reviewers on a pull request, you can create a [`group`](../guides/syntax#group) and use both [`reviewers`](./built-ins#review) and [`requestedReviewers`](./built-ins#requestedreviewers) built-ins.

Here's an example:

```yml
groups:
  - name: all-reviewers
    spec: $append($reviewers(), $requestedReviewers())
```

:::

**Description**:

Retrieves the list of GitHub user logins that have reviewed the pull request.

**Parameters**:

_none_

**Return value**:

| Type       | Description                                                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[]string` | The list of GitHub user logins that have reviewed the pull request. |

**Examples**:

```yml
$reviewers()
```

A `reviewpad.yml` example:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
