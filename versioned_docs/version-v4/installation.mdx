## Step 3. Accept the onboarding pull request

After installing Reviewpad, an onboarding pull request is created in **each** repository where Reviewpad is installed.

**You can accept the onboarding pull request by merging it.**

By merging the onboarding pull request, the Reviewpad configuration file `reviewpad.yml` is added to the root of your repository.

That's it! :tada:

You are ready to use Reviewpad to automate your pull request process.

:::info

Please note that you will need to merge the onboarding pull request for **each** repository where Reviewpad is installed.

:::

### Didn't get the onboarding pull request?

If you have a lot of repositories, it might take a while for Reviewpad to create the onboarding pull requests.

If you don't see an onboarding pull request after a few minutes, please [create the Reviewpad configuration file manually](#create-the-reviewpad-configuration-file-manually).

If you have any issues please reach us on our [community server](https://reviewpad.com/discord).

## Step 4. Tune your Reviewpad configuration

With Reviewpad now up and running, you can adapt it to your specific requirements by following the [5 Minutes Tutorial](/)
