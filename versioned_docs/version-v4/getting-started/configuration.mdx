For Reviewpad to work, it needs a configuration file called **`reviewpad.yml`** in the **root** of your repository.

This configuration is where you define the **automations** that Reviewpad will run on every pull request.

There are **two ways** to add the `reviewpad.yml` configuration file to your repository:
- [Accept the onboarding pull request](#accept-the-onboarding-pull-request)
- [Create the configuration file manually](#create-the-reviewpad-configuration-file-manually)

## Accept the onboarding pull request {#accept-the-onboarding-pull-request}

After installing Reviewpad, an onboarding pull request is created in **each** repository where Reviewpad is installed.

**You can accept the onboarding pull request by merging it.**

By merging the onboarding pull request, the Reviewpad configuration file `reviewpad.yml` is added to the root of your repository.

That's it! :tada:

You are ready to use Reviewpad to automate your pull request process.

:::info

Please note that you will need to merge the onboarding pull request for **each** repository where Reviewpad is installed.

### Didn't get the onboarding pull request?

If you have a lot of repositories, it might take a while for Reviewpad to create the onboarding pull requests.

If you don't see an onboarding pull request after a few minutes, please [create the Reviewpad configuration file manually](#create-the-reviewpad-configuration-file-manually).

If you have any issues please reach us on our [community server](https://reviewpad.com/discord).

## Create the Reviewpad configuration file manually {#create-the-reviewpad-configuration-file-manually}

Create a file called `reviewpad.yml` in the **root** of your repository and add the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{OnboardingConfiguration}</CodeBlock>

Do not forget to **push** the file to the repository.

That's it! :tada:

Reviewpad will run on every pull request and follow the workflows defined in the `reviewpad.yml` configuration file.
