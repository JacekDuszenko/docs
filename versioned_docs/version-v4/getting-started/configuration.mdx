:::info

If you have selected the option **`Only select repositories`** during the [installation](installation) you **don't need** to follow this guide.

Reviewpad will **automatically** create a pull request in the select repositories with the configuration file.

You will need to merge the pull requests to start using Reviewpad.

:::

Now that you have installed Reviewpad it's time to configure it.

**The Reviewpad configuration is a YAML file that defines the workflows that automate your pull request process.**

In this example, we will add a configuration with some of the **best practices** for pull request reviews.

## Add `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository

:::caution

Please note that you will need to add a `reviewpad.yml` file to **each repository** where you wish to use Reviewpad.

:::

Reviewpad will look for a `reviewpad.yml` file in the root of your repository and follow the workflows defined in it.

Create a file called `reviewpad.yml` in the root of your repository and add the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{OnboardingConfiguration}</CodeBlock>

That's it! :tada:

Reviewpad will run on every pull request and follow the workflows defined in the `reviewpad.yml` configuration file.

**ðŸ‘‰ Don't forget to commit and push the `reviewpad.yml` file to your repository.**
