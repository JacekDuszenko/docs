## Welcome to Reviewpad! :wave:

**:zap: Reviewpad is an application to speed up, secure, and automate your code review process on GitHub.**

Reviewpad reads the ** `reviewpad.yml` configuration file** from your repository.

This configuration is where you can specify your pull request **workflows** and **pipelines**.

Reviewpad **enforces** and **automates those processes** so developers can focus on what matters.

## Why Reviewpad? :heart_eyes:

**Pull requests aren't all the same. Why use the same process for all?**

Most actions around pull requests such as reviewer assignment, labelling, and attention drawing vary for each pull request. And in most cases, these actions are still manual.

For each pull request, it is up to the developer to understand the process and follow it. This is a waste of time and energy.

:muscle: **We believe that most of these actions follow an implicit team policy that could be specified and automated.**

We have created Reviewpad to help you **automate policies** around pull requests, such as:
1. Labelling;
2. Review assignment;
3. Custom code quality and security comments;
4. Merge automation.

Finally, having Reviewpad configuration in a Git repository is a great way to share your team's **policies** with other teams,
**build consistent processes** across the organization, and **help new developers** onboard faster.
