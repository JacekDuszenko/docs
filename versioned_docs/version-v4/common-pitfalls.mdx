Reviewpad is a powerful tool that can help streamline your review process, but like any software, it can be easy to make mistakes.

By familiarizing yourself with these common mistakes, you can avoid them and get the most out of Reviewpad.

We hope that this page will help you become a more efficient and effective user of Reviewpad.

## 1. `Parse error: failed to build AST`

This error means that Reviewpad wasn't able to parse a property `spec` defined in the configuration.

Some of the common parsing errors are:

### 1.1 Using `'` instead of `"` for strings

| :x:                  | :white_check_mark:    |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `$addLabel('hello')` |  `$addLabel("hello")` |

### 1.2 Missing the `$` prefix when using a built-in

| :x:                        | :white_check_mark:          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `hasFileName("README.md")` | `$hasFileName("README.md")` |

### 1.3 Missing the parenthesis `()` when using a built-in

| :x:         | :white_check_mark:   |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `$isMerged` | `$isMerged()`        |

## 2. Using `seconds` on [relative timestamps](./use-cases/timestamps/#relative-timestamps)

For now, Reviewpad only supports minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years on relative timestamps. Using seconds will result in an error.

| :x:                  | :white_check_mark:  |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| `60 seconds ago`     | `1 minute ago`      |

Here's an example of the error:

```yml
workflows:
  - name: maybe-LGTM
    if:
    # This will fail because we are using seconds
    - rule: $totalCodeReviews() > 1 && $createdAt() < 60 seconds ago
    then:
    - $comment("This PR got a fast review. Is it a LGTM?")
```
