**Description**:

Activates the `reviewpad merge gate` check. This check will prevent the merge button from being clicked if set as a required check in the repository settings.

:::info `reviewpad merge gate`

Sadly, GitHub does not offer a way to disable a pull request merge button directly.

This built-in provides a way to disable the merge button by adding a [commit status check](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-commit-statuses) called `reviewpad merge gate`.

However, for this built-in to prevent the merge button from being clicked, you must set the check `reviewpad merge gate` as a required check in the repository settings. You can check how to do that [here](/use-cases/blocking-merge).

Only by doing this, the merge button will be disabled when using `disableMerge` built-in.
