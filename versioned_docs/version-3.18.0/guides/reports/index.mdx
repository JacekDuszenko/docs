Reviewpad provides reporting capabilities to help you create awareness around your pull requests and insights into the pull requests life cycle.

It offers different types of reports described below.

## User-generated report

The first kind of report is the user-generated report created when using the built-ins [info](/guides/built-ins#info), [warn](/guides/built-ins#warn), and [error](/guides/built-ins#error) in your Reviewpad file.

### Example

Here is an example of a Reviewpad file and the report generated when the pull request gets old.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Stale}</CodeBlock>

## Executed actions report

The second type of report is the report generated by Reviewpad with the executed actions.

When Reviewpad runs, for each workflow it evaluates the workflow conditions and if the conditions are met it will execute the actions provided in the workflow and append the executed actions to the report. At the end of the run, Reviewpad will generate a report with all the executed actions.

:::caution

This report is only generated if the [mode](/guides/syntax/#mode) configuration in your Reviewpad file is set to `verbose`

:::

### Example

Here is an example of a Reviewpad file and the executed actions report generated if all the conditions are met.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Verbose}</CodeBlock>

## Metrics report

The last type of report is the metrics report, which is generated when a pull request is merged.

This report provides insights into the pull requests life cycle from the moment coding begins up to the time the pull request is merged.

This report contains the following metrics:
- **Coding time**: the amount of time between the first commit and the pull request was created.
- **Pickup time**: the amount of time between the when the pull request was created and the first review was given.
- **Review time**: the amount of time between the first review and the pull request was merged.

:::caution

This report is only generated if the [metrics-on-merge](/guides/syntax/#metrics-on-merge) property in your Reviewpad file is set to `true`
