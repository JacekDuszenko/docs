It can be tiresome to open a pull request and realize that it has Git conflicts.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration file that labels pull requests that have Git conflicts.

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Reviewpad Action

In order to have the automation for the labelling of pull requests that have Git conflicts we can use the following [reviewpad action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewpad-action) configuration that will be triggered whenever there is a push to the `main` branch.

```yaml reviewpad.yml
name: Reviewpad

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  reviewpad:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Reviewpad
        uses: reviewpad/action@v3.x
```
