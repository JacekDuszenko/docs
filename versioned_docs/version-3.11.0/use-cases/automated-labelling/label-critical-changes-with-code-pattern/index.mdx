The [hasCodePattern](/guides/built-ins#hascodepattern) built-in allows you to query the code contained in the diff to understand if, for example, particular function calls were changed or sensitive data (such as passwords or access tokens) are being explicitly added to the code.

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
