Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration that labels pull requests authored by a member of a group of developers.

Suppose that, as Spotify, you consider developers _new joiner_ until they create/merge their [10th pull request](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify/). Each time a _new joiner_ creates a pull request, you want to label it in order to be able to perform a dedicated code review process. Using Reviewpad groups you can easily do such labeling.

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
