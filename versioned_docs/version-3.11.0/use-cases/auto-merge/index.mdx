The ability to configure automatic pull requests merges can greatly unblock developers that typically wait for hours, or even days, to receive a LGTM review.

Since not every pull request needs the same review process, using the semantic features of Reviewpad, you can configure many scenarios where auto-merge seems natural.

Out of the box, Reviewpad supports a [merge action](/guides/built-ins#merge) which can be used in multiple scenarios.

## Auto-merge based on file properties

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example1}</CodeBlock>

## Auto-merge small pull requests

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example2}</CodeBlock>

## Auto-merge non-critical pull requests

The [**hasAnnotation**](/guides/built-ins#hasannotation) built-in can be used to configure powerful auto-merges. See a more in-depth example of the usage of [**hasAnnotation**](/guides/built-ins#hasannotation) in the [automated labelling section](/use-cases/label-critical-changes-with-semantic-code-annotations).

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example3}</CodeBlock>
