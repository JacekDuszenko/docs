## v4.2.0

**15 March 2023**

### Introduction

This update includes two bug fixes. The [`$hasRequiredApprovals`](/guides/built-ins#hasrequiredapprovals) built-in now looks into the latest reviews of the required approvals. The [`$workflowStatus`](/guides/built-ins#workflowstatus) now returns the correct status of the workflow.

### Bugs :bug:

- [`$hasRequiredApprovals`](/guides/built-ins#hasrequiredapprovals) built-in now looks into the latest reviews of the required approvals. This ensures that the built-in is `true` only when all required reviewers have approved their latest review.
- [`$workflowStatus`](/guides/built-ins#workflowstatus) built-in now returns the correct status of the workflow. Before this update, the built-in was not able to return the status of the workflow when the workflow was triggered by a pull request.
