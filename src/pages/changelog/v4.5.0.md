## v4.5.0

**6 April 2023**

### Introduction

This release introduces the new built-ins [`$subMatchesString`](/guides/built-ins#submatchesstring) and [`$extractMarkdownHeadingContent`](/guides/built-ins#extractmarkdownheadingcontent). The former extracts the first match on a string based on a given regular expression pattern. The latter extracts content from a Markdown heading with the title and the heading level. It also includes an improvement on the [`$eventType`](/guides/built-ins#eventtype) built-in that now works for issues.
