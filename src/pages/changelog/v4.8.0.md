## v4.8.0

**5 May 2023**

### Introduction

This release deprecates the property `always-run`, updates the command [`assign-reviewers`](/guides/commands#assign-reviewers) and improves the built-in [`$assignRandomReviewer`](/guides/built-ins/#assignrandomreviewer).

### Improvements :rocket:

- The property `always-run` from the `workflow` specification is deprecated and workflows are now executed independently of each other. This means that a workflow is executed regardless of the result of the previous workflow.
- The command [`assign-reviewers`](/guides/commands#assign-reviewers) now takes the total number of reviewers to assign as an argument and assigns them using the built-in [`$assignCodeAuthorReviewers`](/guides/built-ins/#assigncodeauthorreviewers).
- The built-in [`$assignRandomReviewer`](/guides/built-ins/#assignrandomreviewer) now fails silently when there are no reviewers available. A warning is logged into the execution log.
