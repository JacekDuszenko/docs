### Introduction

This release introduces the `run` property which allows running one or multiple actions and to use `if` statements that include both `then` and `else` fields.

### Improvements :rocket:

#### YAML Specification

We are introducing the `run` property which allows us to:
- Run one or multiple actions.
- Use an `if` statement that includes both `then` and `else` fields.
- Use nested `if` statements by placing them within other `if` statements.

Here's an example of the new syntax:

```yaml
workflows:
  # Running a single action
  - name: Run single action
    run: $addLabel("test")

  # Running multiple actions
  - name: Run multiple actions
    run:
      - $addLabel("test")
      - $info("test")

  # Running action with if statement
  - name: Run with if
    run:
      - if: $author() == "bot"
        then: $addLabel("bot")
        else: $addLabel("human")

  # Running action with nested if statements
  - name: Run with nested if
    run:
      - if: $author() == "bot"
        then:
          - if: $state() == "open"
            then: $addLabel("open")
            else: $addLabel("closed")
        else: $addLabel("human")
```
