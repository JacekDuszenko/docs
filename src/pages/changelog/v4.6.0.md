## v4.6.0

**13 April 2023**

### Introduction

This release introduces a more condensed version of the `if`, `then`, and `actions` fields. It also includes a bug fix for the [`$hasRequiredApprovals`](/guides/built-ins#hasrequiredapprovals) built-in and a fix for a bug that caused Reviewpad to fail when a review was dismissed.

### Improvements :rocket:

#### YAML Specification

We have introduced a more concise form for the `if`, `then`, and `actions` fields. This compact form can be used when there is a one-line condition for `if` and/or a single action for `then`.

For instance:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: label too large pull requests
    if: $size() >= 100
    then: $addLabel("large")
```

Instead of:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: label too large pull requests
    if:
      - $size() >= 100
    then:
      - $addLabel("large")
```

As for the `actions` field, it can be used when there is a single action to be executed. For instance:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: renovate-bot
    trigger: $author() == "renovate[bot]"
    stages:
      - actions: $assignAssignees($group("owners"), 1)
        until: $assignees() != []
```

Instead of:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: renovate-bot
    trigger: $author() == "renovate[bot]"
    stages:
      - actions:
          - $assignAssignees($group("owners"), 1)
        until: $assignees() != []
```

### Bugs :bug:

- [`$hasRequiredApprovals`](/guides/built-ins#hasrequiredapprovals) built-in now only takes into account opinionated reviews, meaning that reviews with a state of `APPROVED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` will be considered, while those with a different state will not be considered.
- Previously, Reviewpad would fail when a review was dismissed, but now this issue has been resolved.
