## v4.9.0

**16 May 2023**

### Introduction

This release updates the built-in [`$assignCodeAuthorReviewers`](/guides/built-ins/#assigncodeauthorreviewers).

### Improvements :rocket:

- The built-in [$assignCodeAuthorReviewers](/guides/built-ins/#assigncodeauthorreviewers) now does not assign a code author as a reviewer if they already have performed a review on the pull request.
