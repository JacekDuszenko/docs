Pull requests labels are widely used by software developers to communicate required actions.

Out of the box, Reviewpad supports the action of [adding labels to pull requests](/guides/built-ins#addlabel).

Together with the other [built-in capabilities](/guides/built-ins), you can automate flexible pull request labelling workflows.
