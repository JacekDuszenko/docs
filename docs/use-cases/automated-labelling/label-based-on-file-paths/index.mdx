Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration that labels pull requests that contain changes to a certain filepath.

This is useful when we want to automatically assign a reviewer based on the files that were changed or label a pull request as critical when it contains changes to critical files.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
