A `stale issue / pull request` is one which does not have activity for X time duration.

## Add stale label to an issue / pull request and close it if it remains inactive after stale labelling

The following configuration checks for a non-stale issue/pull request if it has been inactive for more than one month and, if so, add the stale label.

If after this labeling, the stale issue/pull request remains inactive for more 7 days, then a comment to the issue/pull request is made, notifying of the inactivity, and closes it.

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Reviewpad Action

In order to have the automation for `stale issues / pull requests` working properly we need to update our [reviewpad action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewpad-action) by adding a cron job to schedule the stale test.

```yaml reviewpad.yml
name: Reviewpad

on:
    schedule:
        # Run every day at midnight
        - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
    reviewpad:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Reviewpad
              uses: reviewpad/action@v3.x
```
