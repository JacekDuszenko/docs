The `Attention Set` defines **what kind of attention a pull request needs at a certain time**.

For instance, a just created pull request with an assigned reviewer requires the reviewer attention but not the author attention.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration file that labels pull requests according to the required attention set - in order to define the attention set we will use the built-ins [isWaitingForReview](/guides/built-ins#iswaitingforreview) and [hasUnaddressedThreads](/guides/built-ins#hasunaddressedthreads).

<CodeBlock language="yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Reviewpad Action

In order to have the automation for `Attention Set` working properly we need to update our [reviewpad action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewpad-action), mainly the list of `events` to which reviewpad action is triggered.

```yaml reviewpad.yml
name: Reviewpad

# List of events that will trigger reviewpad
on:
    pull_request_target:
        types:
            - opened
            - reopened
            - synchronize
            - ready_for_review
            - converted_to_draft
            - edited
            - review_requested
            - review_request_removed
    pull_request_review:
    pull_request_review_comment:

    reviewpad:

        steps:
            - name: Reviewpad
              uses: reviewpad/action@v3.x
```

## Known issues

### Unavailable `pull_request_review_thread` event

As for now GitHub actions are not able to be triggered on `pull_request_review_thread` events. This limitation does not allow `reviewpad` to be triggered when a review thread status is updated (i.e. `resolved` or `unresolved`)

To solve this issue one can comment a pull request with:

```go
/reviewpad run
```
