**Description**:

Checks if all check runs for a pull request have been completed.

If the `check_runs_to_ignore` parameter is provided the checks with a name included in the parameter will be ignored.

If the `conclusion` parameter is provided, all check runs must be complete with the provided conclusion.

The `conclusion` parameter can be one of `action_required`, `cancelled`, `failure`, `neutral`, `success`, `skipped`, `stale` or `timed_out`.

If the `check_conclusions_to_ignore` parameter is set, any checks with a conclusion that appears in the `check_conclusions_to_ignore` list will be ignored.

:::caution

This built-in is not available for [`issue`](/guides/syntax#workflow).

:::caution Known issue

Please note that Reviewpad will run for every check run that is completed.

This can be an issue if the checks finish around the same time and you use built-ins that are not idempotent (e.g. the [comment](guides/built-ins#comment) built-in).
In this case, Reviewpad will run the built-in multiple times.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration:

```yml
api-version: reviewpad.com/v3.x

workflows:
  - name: all-checks-completed
    if:
    - $haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success", ["skipped"])
    then:
    - $comment("Hello")
```

In this example, if you have 5 check runs Reviewpad will run 5 times.
If all checks finish with `success` around the same time, when Reviewpad runs for each check run, all checks have already been completed with `success` and Reviewpad will run the `$comment` built-in. This will result in 5 comments.

| `check_conclusions_to_ignore` (optional) | `[]string` | List of check conclusions to be disregarded. Any checks with a conclusion in that list will be ignored. |

**Return value**:

| Type       | Description                                                 |

| `boolean`  | `true` if all check runs have completed, `false` otherwise. |

**Examples**:

#### All check runs have completed with `success`.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted()
```

#### All check runs have been completed except for the `integration-tests` check.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted(["integration-tests"])
```

#### All check runs have been completed with `success`.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success")
```


#### All check runs have been completed with `success` ignoring the checks with `skipped` conclusion.
```yml
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted([], "success", ["skipped"])
```
