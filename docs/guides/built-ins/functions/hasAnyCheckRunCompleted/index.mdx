[Please make sure you use the **check run name** and not the check suite name.](../../troubleshooting#use-check-run-name)

:::

:::caution Known issue

Please note that Reviewpad will run for **every check run** that is completed.

This can be an issue if you use built-ins that are not idempotent (e.g. the [comment](./built-ins#comment) built-in).
In this case, Reviewpad will run the built-in multiple times.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration:

```yml
workflows:
  - name: has-any-check-run-completed
    if:
      - $hasAnyCheckRunCompleted()
    then:
      - $comment("Hello")
```

In this example, if you have 5 checks Reviewpad comment "Hello" 5 times.

**Description**:

Checks, whether any check runs for a pull request, have been completed with the provided conclusions.

If the `check_runs_to_ignore` parameter is provided, any check runs that have a name included in the parameter will be ignored.

If the `check_conclusions` parameter is provided, only check runs that have been completed with one of the provided conclusions will be considered.

The `check_conclusions` parameter accepts the following values: `action_required`, `cancelled`, `failure`, `neutral`, `success`, `skipped`, `stale`, and `timed_out`.

**Parameters**:

| Parameter                         | Type       | Description                                                   |
| :---------------------------------| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `check_runs_to_ignore` (optional) | `[]string` | List of check run names to be disregarded. By default, is []  |
| `check_conclusions` (optional)    | `[]string` | List of the final conclusions of the check. By default, is [] |

**Return value**:

| Type       | Description                                                                                              |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `boolean`  | `true` if there is at least one check completed with one of the provided conclusions, `false` otherwise. |

**Examples**:

#### Any check run has been completed with any conclusion.
```yml
$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted()
```

#### Any check run has failed.
```yml
$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted([], ["failure"])
```

#### Any check run has been skipped or failed.
```yml
$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted([], ["skipped", "failure"])
```

#### Any check run has been completed with skipped except for the `integration-tests` check run.
```yml
$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted(["integration-tests"], ["skipped"])
```
