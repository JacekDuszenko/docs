**Description**:

Assigns a random user of the GitHub organization as the reviewer.
This action will always pick a user different than the author of the pull request.

However, if the pull request already has a reviewer, nothing happens. This is to prevent
adding a reviewer each time the pull request is updated.

When there's no reviewers to assign to, an error is returned.

**Parameters**:

_none_

**Examples**:

```yml
$assignRandomReviewer()
```

A `reviewpad.yml` example:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
