Reviewpad provides reporting capabilities to help you create awareness around your pull requests and insights into the pull requests life cycle.

It offers different types of reports described below.

## User-generated report

The first kind of report is the user-generated report created when using the built-ins [info](/guides/built-ins#info), [warn](/guides/built-ins#warn), and [error](/guides/built-ins#error) in your Reviewpad file.

### Example

Here is an example of a Reviewpad file and the report generated when the pull request gets old.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Stale}</CodeBlock>

## Metrics report

The last type of report is the metrics report, which is generated when a pull request is merged.

This report provides insights into the pull requests life cycle from the moment coding begins up to the time the pull request is merged.

This report contains the following metrics:
- **Coding time**: the time elapsed between the first commit and the creation of the pull request.
- **Pickup time**: the time elapsed between the creation of the pull request and the submission of the first review.
- **Review time**: the time elapsed between the submission of the first review and the merge of the pull request.

:::caution

This report is only generated if the [metrics-on-merge](/guides/syntax#metrics-on-merge) property in your Reviewpad file is set to `true`
