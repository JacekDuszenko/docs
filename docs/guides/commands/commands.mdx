Reviewpad commands introduce the ability to trigger reviewpad actions through a command-like instruction using pull request comments.

This is particularly useful when you want to trigger actions on a pull request that are not specified in the reviewpad configuration file.

A command is a comment that follows the following format:

```shell
/reviewpad [ACTION] [ACTION_ARGUMENTS]
```

Where ACTION is the action to be triggered and ACTION_ARGUMENTS are the arguments to be passed to the action.

## Available commands

* [/reviewpad assign-reviewers](#assign-reviewers) - Assign reviewers to a pull request.

### assign-reviewers
