The Metric Report is automatically generated when a pull request is merged if the [metrics-on-merge](/guides/syntax#metrics-on-merge) property in the Reviewpad file is set to `true`.

This report provides insights into the pull requests life cycle from the moment coding begins up to the time the pull request is merged.

This report contains the following metrics:
- **Coding time**: the time elapsed between the first commit and the creation of the pull request.
- **Pickup time**: the time elapsed between the creation of the pull request and the submission of the first review.
- **Review time**: the time elapsed between the submission of the first review and the merge of the pull request.

### Example

Here is an example of a metrics report generated by Reviewpad when a pull request is merged.
