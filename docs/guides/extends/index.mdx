# Extends

Through the `extends` property, Reviewpad users can extend the current configuration from other configurations.

This allows the ability to share common specifications for all the flags, labels, rules and workflows
from multiple GitHub repositories with the possibility to override the inherited configurations.


## How it works

In the Reviewpad configuration, users specify in the `extends` property
a list of other Reviewpad configuration files as GitHub blob urls (e.g. `https://github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/blob/main/reviewpad.yml`).

As an example:
```yml
api-version: reviewpad.com/v3.x

extends:
  - https://github.com/baz/foo/blob/main/common.yml
  - https://github.com/baz/qux/blob/main/team_a.yml
```

These GitHub blob urls can live in different repositories.

:::caution

Please note that Reviewpad GitHub App (or the underlying token used to run Reviewpad) has to be able to read the contents of these repositories.
You can do it by installing the Reviewpad GitHub App in all repositories (or the whole organization) where you which to extend Reviewpad from.

In the example above, Reviewpad GitHub App needs to be installed either in the organization `baz` or in both projects `foo` and `qux`.

:::

The final configuration is computed by concatenating all configurations included in the extends section
(in the order they are specified) with the contents of the current configuration.

If properties have the same name, the one that was defined last overrides the previous ones.

For example, consider the following specification:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Reviewpad}</CodeBlock>

Where `common.yml`:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="common.yml">{ReviewpadCommon}</CodeBlock>

and `team_a.yml`:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="team_a.yml">{ReviewpadTeamA}</CodeBlock>

The final configuration will be:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{ReviewpadFinal}</CodeBlock>
