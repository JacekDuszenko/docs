**The final step is to add your `reviewpad.yml` configuration file to your repository.**

##  Final step - Define your configuration

In order for Reviewpad to run, you need to add a file named `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository.

This file contains the configuration for Reviewpad.

Let's add a simple Reviewpad configuration. You can change it later on :muscle:

On the root of your repository create the `reviewpad.yml` file and add the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml">{LabelSizeConfiguration}</CodeBlock>
