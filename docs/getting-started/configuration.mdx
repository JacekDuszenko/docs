Now that you have installed Reviewpad it's time to configure it.

**The Reviewpad configuration is a YAML file that defines the workflows that to follow to automate your pull request process.**

In this example we will create a configuration that checks the size of a pull request and adds a label with the size.

## Add `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository

Reviewpad will look for a `reviewpad.yml` file in the root of your repository and follow the workflows defined in it.

Create a file called `reviewpad.yml` in the root of your repository and add the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml">{LabelSizeConfiguration}</CodeBlock>

That's it! :tada:

Reviewpad will run on every pull request and follow the workflows defined in the `reviewpad.yml` configuration file.

**ðŸ‘‰ Don't forget to commit and push the `reviewpad.yml` file to your repository.**
