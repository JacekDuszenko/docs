We have designed a playground for you to **play with Reviewpad** and get a feel for how it works.

You will find the following major components:
1. **Use cases** - These are some scenarios you can try. Each use case has a proposed Reviewpad configuration and a pull request to run the configuration against.
2. **Configuration** - This is the Reviewpad configuration defined to represent the use case. You can edit and see the results by running Reviewpad against the selected pull request.
3. **Pull request** - This is the pull request that Reviewpad will run against. You can edit the pull request and see the results by running Reviewpad against it.
4. **Output** - This is the output of Reviewpad when it runs against the selected pull request with the selected configuration. Please note that Reviewpad will run in dry-run mode, so it will not make any changes to the pull request.
