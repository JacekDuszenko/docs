This guide describes how to install Reviewpad :zap:

:::caution CAUTION

Reviewpad runs as a GitHub App so in order to install it you need to be an admin of the GitHub organization or repository where you wish to install it.

Not able to install a GitHub App? Consider installing [Reviewpad as a GitHub Action](/getting-started/installation-action-tokenized) instead.

After you click the green button `Install` you will be redirected to Reviewpad documentation.

## Step 3. Add `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository

In order for Reviewpad to run, you need to add a file named `reviewpad.yml` to the root of your repository.

This file contains the configuration for Reviewpad.

Let's add a simple Reviewpad configuration. You can change it later on :muscle:

On the root of your repository create the `reviewpad.yml` file and add the following content:

<CodeBlock language="yml">{LabelSizeConfiguration}</CodeBlock>

This particular configuration will label every pull requests based on their size.

That's it! :tada:

**Don't forget to commit and push the `reviewpad.yml` file to your repository.**

Reviewpad will run on every pull request and follow the configuration you have set.
